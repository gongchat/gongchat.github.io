### Changes

- Update message now says "Install After Restart" instead of "Later".
- Added show option in the tray for Windows
- Routing of messages has been improved. When Gong encounters a user that is
  logged into more than one chat client it will now send messages to the client
  that it last received a message from. Before Gong relied on the XMPP server to
  prioritize which client to send a message too.
- Remove tray icon from Linux. The tray icon will only be used for status
  purposes moving forward. See the Electron
  [docs](https://electronjs.org/docs/api/tray#class-tray) for more details.
- Included a .deb installation file for Linux users and is now the default file
  type for this site. Some users have had issues adding Gong to the favorites
  bar with the previous format.
- Added license, Apache 2.0

### Fixes

- Fix horizontal scroll bar for messages with long words.
- Can no longer open Gong twice, instead will focus on current Gong instance.
